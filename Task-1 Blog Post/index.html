    <h1 class="title">The Role of AI in Web Development</h1>
    <p class="meta">Written by <span class="author">Harsh Vaghani</span> | June 26, 2025</p>

    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way websites are built and experienced. From personalized content to automated coding, AI brings efficiency, intelligence, and innovation to modern web development workflows.</p>

    <h2>Smarter User Experiences</h2>
    <p>AI enables websites to adapt to users in real time. Chatbots offer instant support, recommendation engines suggest relevant content, and behavior tracking helps personalize layouts—all of which improve engagement and satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>Automation in Development</h2>
    <p>AI tools like code assistants and layout generators help developers build faster and smarter. They can suggest improvements, detect bugs, and even write boilerplate code, freeing developers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.</p>

    <p class="conclusion">AI isn't replacing developers—it's empowering them. By combining human creativity with machine intelligence, web development becomes more responsive, scalable, and user-focused than ever before.</p>
